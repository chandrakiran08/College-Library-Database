# College Library Database
The "College Library Database" project is a Java Swing-based user interface database management system project that aims to maintain data in a database without the need to use SQL directly. The project's goal is to develop a database management system that will effectively manage the college library's data, including books, authors, and users.  

The system will use MySQL as the database environment, and JDBC Connector will be used to establish a connection between the Java application and the database. The project will be developed using the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment.  

The project's user interface will be developed using Java Swing, providing a user-friendly and visually appealing interface to manage the library's data. The system will allow the librarian to add, update, and delete books, authors, and user information.  

The project will implement security features such as user authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access and manage the library data. The system will also provide a search functionality, allowing the librarian to search for books based on different criteria, such as book title, author name, and publication date.  
 
Overall, the "College Library Database" project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly system for managing the college library's data, helping the librarian to keep track of the library's resources and improve the library's overall efficiency.
