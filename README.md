# College Library Database
This is a Database Management System project with a Java Swing-based UI. The primary objective of this project is to maintain data in the database without using SQL directly.  
To achieve this, I have utilized various environments such as MySQL, Eclipse, and JDBC Connector. Through this project, I have gained practical experience in database management, UI development, and programming with Java.  
The main features of this project include managing the records of books, students, and transactions in the library. The UI design is user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to access and manage the data in the library database.  
Overall, the College Library Database project has allowed me to develop my skills in database management, programming, and UI development, while also demonstrating my ability to design and implement a practical solution to a real-world problem.
